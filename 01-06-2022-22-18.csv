Instead, Domino should be used as needed, data and code sync'd back to the main project and the session be terminated upon completion of work for the day.

Domino usage will be evaluated monthly and owners of interactive runs older than 30 days will be notified that their runs will be terminated within 3 days. It should be noted that, while there is no ceiling on the duration of a run, they do have a cost tied to them, and efficient usage is appreciated. For example, you wouldn't leave your car running overnight in your driveway while you're not using it, even if you had unlimited gasoline, as it is wasteful. In much the same way, you should only have your interactive runs active for as long as you're actively using them (typically, one work day).</p><p><br></p><p>A typical use case:</p><p>1.

However, as data scientists migrated their work to the cloud, they faced bottlenecks spinning up cloud resources and installing the tooling they needed.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>""We had a key challenge faced by many companies: How do we give data scientists fast access to the tooling and capabilities they need in the cloud?,"" asked Atwal. “How do we give them control so they can choose the types of virtual machines they need and deploy their own libraries without waiting for approvals? How do we make it easier for them to share knowledge and bring new data products to market faster? There was a lot of waste in the process—in terms of time, talent, and money—that we wanted to address.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Solution&nbsp;</h1><p>MonenySuperMarket evaluated several data science technologies including Domino Data Lab, Databricks, and Dataiku. They searched for one that would facilitate their journey to the cloud, centralize data science, and accelerate the pace of model development and deployment. ""We chose Domino because it is designed specifically for code-first data scientists and massively reduces friction in their workflows,” said Atwal. “It has become a major part of our DataOps ecosystem, helping us reduce wasted time and enforce better control.”</p><p><br></p><p>Twenty data scientists were up and running on <a href=""https://www.dominodatalab.com/product/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" contenteditable=""false"">the Domino data science platform</a> in a matter of weeks, and immediately saw efficiency gains due to four key capabilities:&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Rapid access to data science tools and compute resources</strong>. Domino acts as an orchestration layer that allows data scientists to independently access containerized research environments and compute resources without sacrificing enterprise controls or compliance standards. ""Domino allows our data scientists to be self-sufficient and far more efficient than they would be otherwise,"" said Atwal. “It frees our DevOps engineers to focus on process innovation so we can scale data science more quickly.”</li><li><strong>Seamless virtual collaboration and knowledge management. </strong>With centralized workflows and automatic capture of every step and artifact associated with data science projects, researchers can easily find, discuss, and reuse existing work. This improves data science project management throughout the lifecycle. ""It’s now much easier for data scientists working on the same project to work on the same code base, and the collaboration capabilities ensure we're not reinventing the wheel or duplicating past work every time we start a new project.""</li><li><strong>Easy model reproducibility and comparison</strong>. “Before, we had to plan configuration management,” said Atwal. “Now we can easily reproduce models between environments because the platform automatically tracks all the relevant information.”</li><li><strong>Fast time to value. </strong>In Domino, data scientists quickly create and deploy interactive dashboards to get models into the hands of business stakeholders faster. “We’ve deployed interactive dashboards to help our business units better understand customers and streamline processes. So, for example, our web team now has visual model-driven dashboards that show how different website experiments are performing.”</li></ul><p><br></p>",Sam Davoodi,AE - EMEA,"<p><img

What Domino could but has yet to do is present a clearly superior approach to native Kubernetes for Model API endpoint development. There are a number of things such as GRPC, native API documentation (swagger), API Gateways, general security stuff, that continue to nudge new deployments away from Domino and toward a more generic Kubernetes approach.

She did have some negative comments around the overall workflow so far. She was very clear and pushed back immediately after the meeting in email about GAO needing to clear 50 Domino employees through the needed security clearance. As per the project plan, she seemed happy to hear some of the positive or non negative feedback from Martin and team.</li><li>Next steps, Sarah needs to get Domino the feedback on the project plan so we can get back to GAO by Tuesday/Wednesday.</li><li>Based on Sarah's rejection of the security clearance, and the additional information about Domino needing to cover the cost, Alex is working with Nick and Ken to approve.</li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>USGAO - Executive Update 1-March:</p><ul><li>Weekly TAM Session: Fridays, 3:00 pm EST.</li><li>Upgrade/Migration sessions: scheduled to resume 25 March, Thursdays, 3:30 pm EST.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>&lt;Critical&gt;</p><ul><li>Alex/Kurt facilitating the RFQ response - submitted -&gt; awaiting Award notification</li><li>TAM Office Hours continuing</li><li>Martin/Ram has deferred the Upgrade meetings until 25 March</li></ul><p><br></p><p>GAO - Neutral due to risk associated with Domino meeting GAO ATO requirements that are inclusive of:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><div>Solicitation for expanding Domino to 50 (and up to 100 users) came out late 29 Jan.</div><ul><li>Questions returned to NTS by Kurt</li><li>Full overview sent out internally 30 Jan. - see email for full review - internal review meeting to be scheduled (Graham?)</li></ul></li><li>TAM session held 5 Feb. - standard session</li><li>Trying to push any meetings until internal decision is made</li><li>Training scheduled for 28 Jan.
